## Research Overview

My research is centered on **mathematical statistics**, with a focus on **time series analysis**, **high-dimensional data**, and **non-stationary processes**. I tackle **unsolved statistical problems** that are mathematically challenging and of practical relevance to applied researchers in fields like **finance**, **economics**, and the **natural sciences**. My methods aim to quantify uncertainty using **modern statistical models** and **probabilistic techniques**.

### Key Research Areas
- **Time Series Analysis**: Developing new methodologies for analyzing dependent time series data with complex dynamics.
- **Quantile-Based Spectral Analysis**: A novel approach to analyzing non-linear time series, which is widely adopted by practitioners in fields like finance.
- **High-Dimensional Data**: Creating models for the analysis of data with many variables, particularly in business applications.

### Ongoing Projects
- **Quantile Coherency in Financial Time Series** (with Holger Dette, Josua Gößmann, and others)
- **Stein’s Method for Dependent Data** (independent project)
