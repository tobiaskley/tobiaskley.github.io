## Teaching
I am teaching [B.Mat.1400: Measure and probability theory](https://flexnow2.uni-goettingen.de/modulbeschreibungen/22076.pdf) in the winter term 2024/25 and [M.Mat.0741: Advanced practical course in stochastics](https://flexnow2.uni-goettingen.de/modulbeschreibungen/36702.pdf) in the two week period of 03.03.2025 to 14.03.2025. Please use [StudIP](https://studip.uni-goettingen.de/) to access relevant course materials.

In the past, I have taught courses on time series analysis, mathematical statistics, and data science at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
