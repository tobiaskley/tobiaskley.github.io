I am Tobias Kley, a **mathematical statistician** specializing in **time series analysis**, **high-dimensional data**, and **non-stationary processes**. I am currently a permanent Scientific Staff member at the [**University of GÃ¶ttingen**](https://www.stochastik.math.uni-goettingen.de), where I focus on solving mathematically challenging problems with practical applications in **finance**, **economics**, and other fields. 

With expertise in both **mathematics** and **economics**, my interdisciplinary background allows me to develop innovative methods and models for analyzing **dependent data**. I am passionate about both **research** and **teaching**, having mentored and taught courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

Feel free to explore my research, publications, teaching experience, and other academic activities on this site.
